### ðŸ‘‹ I'm Drew Wyatt (he/him)

I make the internet. 

Right now I mostly make it for [@pelotoncycle](https://github.com/pelotoncycle).

I gave a talk at React Week in 2019 called Hooked on Context, you can find the [video of that here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PwAfK_IutI&t=2s), and the [sample code here](https://github.com/drewwyatt/hooked-on-context).
